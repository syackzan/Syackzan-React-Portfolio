## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted

### Projects

Each project featured my portfolio includes:

* An image of the deployed application

* The title of the project

* A link to the deployed application

### Design

 what that means:

* Use mobile-first design.

* Use of Light Gray's and Browns for a more Earth Tone feel.

* Use Font-size & Style to be easier on the eyes. Nothing too Small or too big that is distracting

* Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it might impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.

### Deployment

* In order to deploy the Git Hub Repository be sure to initiate a build folder with the command `npm run build` once all the React Javascript is finalized. This will provide a build folder in the Folder Structure that allows the browser to read necesarry Coding.
